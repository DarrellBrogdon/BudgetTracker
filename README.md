A simple budgeting, expense, and income tracking app

## Backend

This project includes a simple API server, written in Clojure, that stores files in /tmp (assumes macOS or Linux).  To start it, run `api-server/bin/dev_run.sh` from the command line.  All API requests are hosted at http://localhost:8000/api/1.0
